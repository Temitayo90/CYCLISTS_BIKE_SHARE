##Case study1_Google Data Analytics_Cyclists_Bike_Share

  This is the first case study in the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics professional certificate. This Case Study helps to put into use some of those skills and tools acquired, what the right thought process are, and many more.

##About the Case Study

  Cyclistic is a fictional company that has a bike share program and has many customers who are divided into two groups: 
1. The casual riders - customers with single-ride passes or full-day passes
2. The Cyclistic member - customers who purchase annual membership.
  The marketing director believes the company's future depends on maximizing certain types of customers. As a part of the data analyst team, I have been asked to answer the first question: How do annual members and casual riders use cyclistic bikes differently?
  This being part of the analysis done on the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends as well as aid in designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

##Data analysis

  The tools I used were the ones I thought were right to answer the question given to me, these are R Programming and Excel. The data provided for my tool was divvy_trips 2019 q1 and divvy_tris 2020 q1. Data was cleaned and analyzed using R Programming, while further analysis and visualization were done using Excel.
